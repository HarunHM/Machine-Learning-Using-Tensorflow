# Machine-Learning-Using-Tensorflow

<b> Machine learning </b> is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect. We probably use a learning algorithm dozens of time without even knowing it. Applications of Machine Learning include:
<br />
<br />
<b> Web Search Engine: </b> <br /> One of the reasons why search engines like google, bing etc work so well is because the system has learnt how to rank pages through a complex learning algorithm. <br />
<b> Photo tagging Applications:</b> <br /> Be it facebook or any other photo tagging application, the ability to tag friends makes it even more happening. It is all possible because of a face recognition algorithm that runs behind the application.<br />
<b> Spam Detector:<b/> <br />Our mail agent like Gmail or Hotmail does a lot of hard work for us in classifying the mails and moving the spam mails to spam folder. This is again achieved by a spam classifier running in the back end of mail application. <br />
